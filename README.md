# Dockerized Image Magick

This is a dockerized version of image magick which is precompiled with additional codec support.

## Scripts

For ease of use feel free to use the commands located in `bin`. Each command is simply a shell around the normal image magick commands with the addition of docker volume support and correct argument parsing when passing the commands to the docker container.
